# üíº Salary Prediction Model using IBM Watson AI

This project is a machine learning-based **Salary Prediction Model** that uses **IBM Watson AI services** to accurately predict the expected salary of an individual based on key personal and professional attributes.

## üöÄ Overview

The model takes in several parameters such as educational background, work experience, job title, industry, and more to predict the salary using IBM Watson's powerful AI/ML capabilities. This model is particularly useful for HR departments, job portals, career counseling services, and individuals wanting to benchmark expected salaries.

## üìä Input Parameters

The model expects the following features:

| Feature              | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ID`                 | Unique identifier for each individual                    |
| `education_level`    | Highest degree or level of education                     |
| `years_experience`   | Total number of years of professional experience         |
| `job_title`          | Current or expected job title                            |
| `industry`           | Industry the individual is working in                    |
| `location`           | Geographic location of employment                        |
| `company_size`       | Size of the company (e.g., small, medium, large)         |
| `certifications`     | Any professional certifications held                     |
| `age`                | Age of the individual                                    |
| `working_hours`      | Average weekly working hours                             |

## üéØ Goal

To predict the **salary** of an individual using IBM Watson's AutoAI or custom model deployment, based on the provided inputs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Input data is cleaned, encoded, and structured for model ingestion.
2. **Model Integration**: Trained model is deployed using IBM Watson Machine Learning.
3. **Prediction**: The front-end or script sends the input features to the deployed model and receives the predicted salary.
